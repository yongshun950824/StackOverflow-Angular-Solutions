<h4>Material Date Picker Formatting Problem</h4>
<p>
  Even though my Date formatter says to use YYYY-MM-DD, when I select a date, it says "6/9/2021". Additionally, it's putting the date below the HR in the webpage below for some reason I can't figure. Also, for some reason that date shows to be the last date I selected, unsure why it's even on the page, or what it's significance is.

<hr />
<hello></hello> 
<hr />
