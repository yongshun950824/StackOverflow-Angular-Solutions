# angular-ngbmodal

Test project to investigate the population of an modal poup using a ngb-Modal form and populate it with the contents of a response of a Rest service. In this case a example Rest service from [Reg | Res]( https://reqres.in ) is used to show a list of user names. As a base the [modal example of ng-bootstrap](ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/modal/) is used where the modal resides in a seperate component.
